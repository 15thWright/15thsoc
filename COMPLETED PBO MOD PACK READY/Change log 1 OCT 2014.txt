Massi's Weapons:
Edited to create an M4 Carbine - Only Difference between the M4 Carbine and The M4A1 is Burst Fire, instead of Full Auto.

Edited Weapon Values
M4's,  M16, M240, M249
Changed weapon firing speeds to be more realistic.- M249/M240
Changed dispersion on the M240 and the M249 to be more realistic.
Changed the recoil values on the M4's, M16, M240 and M249.

Edited Sounds and replaced with sound pack De Leo made.

Custom Ammunition created for M4/M16/M249/M240/M9/M1911
M4/ M16 can share ammo, but doing so edits the base values of the weapons, due to Arma using most weapon values within the ammo.

Built in safety has been added to all weapons, To enable safety, just change your rate of fire like you normally would (Full/Semi/M203 etc). 

 EricJ:

M27 IAR Added
It is compatible with Massi stock ammo , AND M4/ M16 custom ammo. It also has its own set of M885a1 Ammo, which can only be used in the M27, this is to bring it to the range and effectiveness it uses realistic. M4/M16 family weapons CANNOT use the M27 ammo, it is locked out.



LAV-25 Chairbornes
Muzzles were not defined properly, Chairborne was given the hotfix and uploaded version to fix. 

 Special note on the new Ammo that has been created:
  
 Due to Arma engine setup, All damage and range of rounds for each weapon change with the Magazine type that is added to each weapon.
  While the M4 can use the M16 magazines, it turns the m4 into an M16.
