Muzzlevelocity v1.01
*******************

What it does:
-------------
Brings you realistic muzzle velocities to all rifles. Barrel length does matter now.

Installation:
-------------
A:
- Unpack the archive to your Arma2-folder
- Add "-mod=@FNC_muzzlevelocity" to your arma2-shortcut

or 

B:
If you are familiar with mod installation just put the files into folders of your choice.

Usage:
------
Fire a weapon, observe the result :)
In the included testmission you get written feedback on the weapon, firemode and muzzle velocity everytime you fire a weapon.

By default the mod handles only bullets fired by the player. If you want it to also handle all local AI, ie. player and AI in his group,
edit the file "Arma2\userconfig\fnc_muzzlevelocity\fnc_muzzlevelocity_config.hpp". Specific instructions are in the file itself.

Requirements:
-------------
Community Base Addons, CBA

Multiplayer:
-----------
This addon is client-side only and fully MP-compatible in this respect.
It should work on a server too, but this is untested.

Mod conflicts:
--------------
Users of 31ST MEU Scopes&Ballistics should take a look at "Arma2\userconfig\fnc_muzzlevelocity\fnc_muzzlevelocity_config.hpp"
and uncomment one line there according the instructions in that file.

Bugs:
-----
No known bugs

How do I get my non-stock weapons to work with this?
--------------------------------------------------------
Add their values to "Arma2\userconfig\fnc_muzzlevelocity\fnc_muzzlevelocity_weapons.hpp" following the example in the mod's config.cpp.
PBO source is included.
