Creation of AT-4 CS -Credit Sgt C. Johnston

Added new M203 ammo. Packs abit more of a punch for it to better kill in a 5meter radius. - Credit Sgt C. Johnston

M27 IAR / M4's /M16  - Credit Sgt D. Schultz
Recoil changes Wrong Value. "Auto" instead of "Single" in wrong spot's. Also wrong number's. 5 instead of 4, etc.

M249 and M240 - Credit Sgt D. Schultz
Adjusted Dispersion.
Lowered the M240 to 0.3 from 0.3. (Also increased Recoil slightly. Based on user feedback)
Increased M249 to 0.35 from 0.2. This was a mistake, now corrected.

ALL WEAPONS AND AMMO'S have had their Weight's ADJUSTED to that of their real world counterparts based on the weight revealed by AGM. On average, the weight of most billets has increased by 20 to 25% - Credit Sgt D. Schultz

Note this does not include items from AGM.
Note this does not include clothing, helments, backpacks, etc that we use from Massie. These are slated to be adjusted for the Oct 30th update.


Sgt Schultz and Sgt Johnston are looking into being able to get rid of the custom ammo's of the M4/M16/M27. This could be possible via a client side script we will be working on for hopeful release Oct 30th.
