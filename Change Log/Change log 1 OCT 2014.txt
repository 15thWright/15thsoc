******************************************************
Massi's Weapons:
Edited to create an M4 Carbine - Only Difference between the M4 Carbine and The M4A1 is Burst Fire, instead of Full Auto.

Edited Weapon Values
M4's,  M16, M240, M249
Changed weapon firing speeds to be more realistic.- M249/M240
Changed dispersion on the M240 and the M249 to be more realistic.
Changed the recoil values on the M4's, M16, M240, M27 and M249.

Edited Sounds and replaced with sound's provided by 1st Sgt De Leo.

Custom Ammunition created for M4/M16/M249/M240/M9/M1911
M4/ M16 can share ammo, but doing so edits the base values of the weapons, due to Arma using most weapon values within the ammo.

Built in safety has been added to all weapons, To enable safety, just change your rate of fire like you normally would (Full/Semi/M203 etc). 

 Special note on the new Ammo that has been created:
  
 Due to Arma engine setup, All damage and range of rounds for each weapon change with the Magazine type that is added to each weapon.
  While the M4 can use the M16 magazines, it turns the m4 into an M16 and vice visa. 

Note that this is an ONGOING process, all feedback is welcome and should be directed to Sgt D. Schultz

******************************************************

Note to Col Penny - There is currently no set policy in the unit as to how the M27 IAR should be utilized. While it is in all the appropriate GCE box’s, they are not, as of yet, added to the pre-loadouts selection.
Currently in the Marine Corp, the M27 IAR has replaced ALL M249’s. With only a few M249’s in a platoon’s armoury to be utilized in defensive roles. 

The Mod Team will be in attendance at the Leadership unit meeting to inform all GCE Leadership about the new weapon.
